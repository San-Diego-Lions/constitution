## Questions & Answers

**Q: Will this make the Board less accountable?**
A: No - financial controls are actually stronger with two-signature requirements and clear spending limits.

**Q: What if I don't have email?**
A: You can still request physical copies of all documents, but electronic delivery becomes the default.

**Q: Will AGM meetings be shorter?**
A: Yes - by pre-distributing detailed reports, we can focus AGM time on elections, questions, and decisions rather than reading lengthy presentations.

**Q: Can the Board now spend money without member approval?**
A: Only within the same limits as before, but with better controls. Major spending (over $10,000) still requires member approval.

**Q: What if someone doesn't do the handover process?**
A: The constitution requires it, and the Board can take appropriate action to ensure club information is transferred.
